# Privacy & Client Confidentiality

**IMPORTANT READING FOR LEGAL PROFESSIONALS**

This document addresses privacy and confidentiality considerations when using this Tool, with particular attention to professional obligations under Nigerian legal professional rules.

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Risks:**
- Queries through Claude API flow via Anthropic cloud infrastructure
- Query content may reveal client matters and privileged information
- Nigerian Bar Association rules require strict confidentiality and data handling controls

**Safe Use Options:**
1. **General Legal Research**: Use Tool for non-client-specific queries
2. **Local npm Package**: Install `@ansvar/nigeria-law-mcp` locally — database queries stay on your machine
3. **Remote Endpoint**: Vercel Streamable HTTP endpoint — queries transit Vercel infrastructure
4. **On-Premise Deployment**: Self-host with local LLM for privileged matters

## Data Flows and Infrastructure

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architecture

This Tool uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to communicate with AI clients:

```
User Query -> MCP Client (Claude Desktop/Cursor/API) -> Anthropic Cloud -> MCP Server -> Database
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Local npm Package (Most Private)

```bash
npx @ansvar/nigeria-law-mcp
```

- Database is local SQLite file on your machine
- No data transmitted to external servers (except to AI client for LLM processing)
- Full control over data at rest

#### 2. Remote Endpoint (Vercel)

```
Endpoint: https://nigeria-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp
```

- Queries transit Vercel infrastructure
- Tool responses return through the same path
- Subject to Vercel's privacy policy

### What Gets Transmitted

When you use this Tool through an AI client:

- **Query Text**: Your search queries and tool parameters
- **Tool Responses**: Statute text, provision content, search results
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, request identifiers

**What Does NOT Get Transmitted:**
- Files on your computer
- Your full conversation history (depends on AI client configuration)

## Professional Obligations (Nigeria)

### Nigerian Bar Association and Legal Practitioners Act

Nigerian lawyers are bound by strict confidentiality rules under the Legal Practitioners Act (Cap L11 LFN 2004) and the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners 2007.

#### Lawyer-Client Privilege

- All lawyer-client communications are privileged under the Evidence Act 2011
- Client identity may be confidential in sensitive matters
- Case strategy and legal analysis are protected
- Information that could identify clients or matters must be safeguarded

### NDPA and Client Data Processing

Under the **Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 (NDPA)**:

- You are the **Data Controller** when processing client personal data
- AI service providers (Anthropic, Vercel) may be **Data Processors**
- A **data processing agreement** is required
- Cross-border data transfers must comply with the NDPA adequacy or safeguard requirements
- The **Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC)** oversees compliance

## Risk Assessment by Use Case

### LOW RISK: General Legal Research

**Safe to use through any deployment:**

```
Example: "What does the Companies and Allied Matters Act say about corporate governance?"
```

- No client identity involved
- No case-specific facts
- Publicly available legal information

### MEDIUM RISK: Anonymized Queries

**Use with caution:**

```
Example: "What are the penalties for money laundering under the Money Laundering Act?"
```

- Query pattern may reveal you are working on an AML matter
- Anthropic/Vercel logs may link queries to your API key

### HIGH RISK: Client-Specific Queries

**DO NOT USE through cloud AI services:**

- Remove ALL identifying details
- Use the local npm package with a self-hosted LLM
- Or use commercial legal databases with proper DPAs

## Recommendations

### For Solo Practitioners / Small Firms

1. Use local npm package for maximum privacy
2. General research: Cloud AI is acceptable for non-client queries
3. Client matters: Use commercial legal databases (Nigeria LII, LawPavilion, LexisNexis Nigeria)

### For Large Firms / Corporate Legal

1. Negotiate DPAs with AI service providers under NDPA requirements
2. Consider on-premise deployment with self-hosted LLM
3. Train staff on safe vs. unsafe query patterns

### For Government / Public Sector

1. Use self-hosted deployment, no external APIs
2. Follow Nigerian government information security requirements (NITDA guidelines)
3. Air-gapped option available for classified matters
