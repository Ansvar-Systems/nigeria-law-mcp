SCHEDULE [Sections 6 and 16.] Proposal for an International Institute of Tropical Agriculture located in Nigeria (MODIFIED) Introduction The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations have for some years been co-operating with developing countries in efforts to increase the production and improve the quality of their food crops. One approach has been to provide assistance in establishing a limited number of regional and international institutions of high quality devoted to research on food crops and to training staff for other research institutions working on similar problems. Consideration is now being given to the possibility of establishing a new international institute that would focus on increasing the production and improving the nutritional values of important tropical food crops. Such an institute could, if mutually satisfactory arrangements can be worked out, be located in Nigeria. Like the International Rice Research Institute, the proposed Institute would be designed to put teams of high-level specialists to work on major problems requiring basic or applied research; it would help train the professional manpower required by other institutions for re- search on tropical food crops; and through international forums, conferences, and seminars, provision of good library facilities and exchange of plant materials, it would assist scientists at other institutions to increase the effectiveness of their programmes. It would be authorised to enter into co-operative research agreements with other institutions and to make small research grants when, in its judgement, these appear to be desirable and effective means of pursuing its objecti ves. Preliminary explorations of the possibility of establishing the proposed Institute were begun in October 1963, when Dr. George Harrar, President of the Rockefeller Foundation and Dr. FF Hill, Vice-President of the Ford Foundation, visited Nigeria to study the feasibility of such a venture. Discussions were held with leading persons in government and at universities. Dr. Harrar and Dr. Hill were accompanied by Professor Richard Bradfield, senior agricultural adviser to the Rockefeller Foundation, who subsequently made an extensive survey of all major agricultural research institutions in Nigeria. These discussions and studies confirmed the suitability of Nigeria as the potential site of the Institute, the mutual interests of Nigerian and Foundation officials in the proposed Institute, and the desirability, therefore, of exploring further the development of an acceptable arrangement for the Institute. General objectives of proposed Institute The general objectives of the proposed Institute are as follows: 1 . To provide in the tropics a high-quality international research organisation devoted to finding ways as quickly as possible to increase the output and improve the quality of tropical food crops. Attention also would be given to soil improvement and feed crops useful in inten- sive crop rotations, Basic research, applied research and experimentation, and fi e ld testing of results would be pursued. All important aspects of the problem of increasing and improving the quality of food production would be investigated, i.e. agronomic, engineering, and eco- nomic. Special attention would be given to studies of soils and the development of crop rota- tions and management systems, particularly in the humid tropics, which would make it pos- sible to use soils more intensively than they are used at present. 2 . To provide, in co-operation with universities and research stations concerned with tropical agriculture, high-level professional training for carefully selected persons who expect to be- come staff members of institutions and organisations in the tropics concerned with increasing food production and improving its quality and distribution. 3 . To publish and disseminate research findings and recommendations of the proposed In- stitute. 4. To distribute improved plant materials to other research centres where they might be of significant value or use in breeding or improvement programmes. 5 . To establish, maintain and operate an information centre and library which will provide for interested scientists and scholars everywhere a collection of the world's literature on tropi- cal agriculture. 6 . To organise or hold periodic conferences, forums and seminars, whether international, regional, local or otherwise, for the purpose of discussing current problems in the field of tropical agriculture. Financing Basic financing of the original capital costs of buildings and equipment would be pro- vided by the Ford Foundation. Recurrent costs of core operating expenses, such as staff salaries and benefits, building and equipment up-keep and replacement, supplies, library, publications, conferences and seminars, etc., would be shared equally by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The Insti- tute would be authorised to receive funds from other sources, both public and private, and once established would actively seek support from other sources for fellowships, special pro- jects and equipment, as well as for general support. Because assurance of long-term financial support is essential to the efficient operation of an agricultural research organisation, the two Foundations would state their intention of sup- porting the core operations of the Institute for a minimum period of fourteen years, assuming satisfactory operation. If, at the end of fourteen years, the Institute, in the judgement of the two Foundations is continuing to perform a service of great importance to tropical agriculture, consideration should be given to extending their support of its core operations for an addi- tional period, fully, in part, or on a declining basis. If, after the Foundations discontinue financial support for the Institute or at some later time it is deemed unnecessary or no longer feasible for the Institute to continue, the physical assets of the Institute would devolve, subject to approval by the Government of Nigeria, to a Nigerian or other appropriate agency. Land requirements To facilitate and strengthen its training programme and provide ready access to qualified scientists and research facilities in related fields, it is proposed that the Institute be located adjacent to the University of Ibadan. It is further proposed that adequate land for the Institute be provided by the Government of Nigeria on long-term lease at a token rent. Because of the number of crops on which experimental work will be done and the wide variation in topography and soils in the Ibadan area, it is estimated that approximately 2,000 acres will be required in one block in the area generally to the north and/or west of the Uni- versity of Ibadan campus. The Foundations are prepared to send qualified persons to Nigeria to establish the exact site requirements as soon as agreement in principle with the Nigerian Government has been reached. The Federal Government will assume legal and financial re- sponsibility for this acquisition and for such other land acquisitions as may be required and mutually agreed upon by the Institute and Government in the future. Smaller acreages for ex- perimental work, field tests and demonstrations in other parts of Nigeria may be required later on. Status The proposed Institute would be established under Nigerian law as an autonomous, non- profit, tax-free organisation, international in character, and operating under policies laid down by its Board of Trustees. Board of Trustees It is proposed that the Institute have a self-perpetuating Board of Trustees of not less than nine nor more than fifteen members. Representation of the Board should reflect its inter- national character. With the exception stated below, Board members would serve for a period of two years with the possibility of serving two successive terms. Terms would be staggered t"
