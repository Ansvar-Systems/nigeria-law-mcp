(3) No change of ownership of the motor vehicle shall, prior to the full repayment or settlement of the loan, be registered by the licensing authority without a certificate of discharge or consent in writing issued by the bank offering the loan to purchase the motor vehicle. (4) Any registration made contrary to the provisions of this section shall be void and shall have no effect whatsoever on the right of ownership or the right to recover possession of the motor vehicle by the bank which had granted the loan for the purchase of such motor vehicle."
