Use of oil pip e line b y a per s on other than the owner (1) An application may be made to the Minister with respect to an oil pipeline con- structed, maintained and operated in pursuance of a licence granted under this Act by any person other than the owner of the pipeline who seeks a right to have conveyed by the pipeline on his behalf any of the things mentioned in subsection (2) of section 11 of this Act which the pipeline is designed to convey. (2) Every such application shall be made in the prescribed manner and form con- taining the prescribed particulars. (3) The Minister shall consider every such application in consultation with the appli- cant and the owner of the pipeline to which the application relates. (4) If upon such consideration the Minister is satisfied that the pipeline could, with- out prejudice to the proper and efficient operation thereof for the purpose of the convey- ance on behalf of the owner, in the quantity required by him, of the thing which it is de- signed to convey, be so operated as to permit of the conveyance thereby on behalf of the applicant of the thing the right to the conveyance of which is sought by the applicant, the Minister shall declare that he is so satisfied. (5) Subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, the conditions of the use of the pipeline by the applicant may be determined by agreement between the owner and the applicant and, failing such agreement, shall, subject as aforesaid, be determined by the Minister. (6) Where the Minister makes under subsection (4) of this section a declaration with regard to a pipeline, he may by notice served on the owner impose such requirements as he thinks it necessary or expedient to impose for all or any of the following purposes, namely- (a) securing to the person whose application resulted in the making of the declara- tion the right to have conveyed by the pipeline the thing to which the applica- tion is related; (b) regulating the charge to be made for the conveyance of such thing by the pipe- line on behalf of that person; (c) securing that the exercise of a right secured by virtue of paragraph (a) of this subsection is not prevented or impeded, but requirements imposed for the purpose specified in paragraph ( a ) of this subsection shall be so framed as, in the Minister's opinion, to secure that compliance therewith will not prejudice the proper and efficient operation of the pipeline for the purpose of the con- veyance on behalf of the owner thereof, in the quantity required by him, of the thing which it is designed to convey. (7) A notice served on the owner of a pipeline under subsection (6) may authorise such owner to recover, from the person to whom a right is secured by the notice by virtue of paragraph (a) of that subsection, payments of such amounts as may be determined in accordance with provisions in that behalf contained in the notice, being payments in con- sideration of the rights being secured to such person. (8) If the owner of a pipeline fails to comply with a requirement imposed by a notice served on him under subsection (6) of this section with reference to the pipeline, he is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding N 1 ,000; and, if the failure continues after his conviction he is guilty of a further offence and li- able, in respect thereof, to a fine not exceeding fifty naira for each day on which the fail- ure continues.

Court having jurisdiction as to compensation If there be any dispute as to whether any compensation is payable under any provision of this Act or if so as to the amount thereof, or as to the persons to whom such compen- sation should be paid, such dispute shall be determined by a magistrate exercising civil jurisdiction in the area concerned if such magistrate has in respect of any other civil mat- ter monetary jurisdiction of at least as much as the amount of compensation claimed, and if there he no such magistrate, by the High Court exercising jurisdiction in the area con- cerned and, notwithstanding the provisions of any other Act or law, in respect of the deci- sion of a magistrate in accordance with this section there shall be an appeal to the High Court of the State and in respect of a decision of the High Court of the State under this section, whether original or appellate, there shall be an appeal to the Court of Appeal: Provided that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to confer power upon a magis- trate to exercise jurisdiction in a matter raising any issue as to the title to land or as to the title to any interest in land. 20. Ba s is of a ss e ss ment of compen s ati o n (1) If a claim is made under subsection (3) of section 6 of this Act, the court shall award such compensation as it considers just in respect of any damage done to any buildings, crops or profitable trees by the holder of the permit in the exercise of his rights thereunder and in addition may award such sum in respect of disturbance (if any) as it may consider just. (2) If a claim is made under subsection (5) of section 11 of this Act, the court shall award such compensation as it considers just, having regard to-- (a) any damage done to any buildings, crops or profitable trees by the holder of the licence in the exercise of the rights conferred by the licence; and (b) any disturbance caused by the holder in the exercise of such rights; and (c) any damage suffered by any person by reason of any neglect on the part of the holder or his agents, servants or workmen to protect, maintain or repair any work, structure or thing executed under the licence; and (d) any damage suffered by any person (other than as stated in such subsection (5) of this section) as a consequence of any breakage of or leakage from the pipe- line or an ancillary installation; and (e) loss (if any) in value of the land or interests in land by reason of the exercise of the rights as aforesaid, and also having regard to any compensation already awarded in accordance with subsec- tion (1) of this section. (3) In determining the loss in value of the land or interests in land of a claimant the court shall assess the value of the land or the interests injuriously affected at the date im- mediately before the grant of the licence and shall assess the residual value to the claim- ant of the same land or interests consequent upon and at the date of the grant of the licence and shall determine the loss suffered by the claimant as the difference between the values so found, if such residual value is a lesser sum. (4) No compensation shall be awarded in respect of unoccupied land as defined in the Land Use Act, except to the extent and in the circumstances specified in that Act. [Cap. L5.) (5) In determining compensation in accordance with the provisions of this section the court shall apply the provisions of the Land Use Act so far as they are applicable and not in conflict with anything in this Act as if the land or interests concerned were land or in- terests acquired by the President for a public purpose. (6) If the total sum awarded by the court in accordance with this section exceeds an amount already offered to the claimant by the holder of the licence the court may order such holder to pay the costs of the proceedings; and if the sum so awarded does not ex- ceed the amount offered by such holder the court shall either order the claimant to pay the cost of the proceedings or order each side to bear its own costs. (7) Compensation (if any) awarded by the court in accordance with this section shall be a sum of money payable forthwith or shall consist of periodical instalments or partly one and partly the other: Provided that nothing contained in this subsection "

C on s tru c tion The guidelines for the construction of a new gas pipeline or for the replacement of an existing gas pipeline shall be as follows, that is- (a) the design and construction of a pipeline and its corresponding corrosion control installation shall be in accordance with the Standards and codes specified in ANSI/ASME B 13.8, and in the National Association of Corrosion Engineers Standard RP 0169-83, generally referred to as NACE Standard RP 0169-83; (b) a long distance gas transmission pipeline shall be made of steel and its design and construction shall be governed by the population density indices specified in ANSI/ASME B31.8 and the corresponding design factor; (c) where a type of construction is specified for a pipeline in the proximity of main roads and railroads and their mode of crossings, the pipeline shall be constructed to those specifications; (d) the minimum depth of burial of the pipeline shall be specified in regula- tion 5 ( h ) of these Regulations but where- (i) the minimum depth cannot be achieved; or (ii) the pipeline would be exposed to excessive external loads, the pipeline, at those points, shall be encased, bridged or specially reinforced to withstand any anticipated external loads; (e) there shall be a minimum clearance of 0.5 metre between the pipeline and any other underground structure not connected with it; (f) a buried pipeline shall be protected against corrosion and if a pipeline is to transport corrosive or toxic gas- (i) the design parameter of the pipeline shall be such that the gas pressure in the pipeline at any time shall not result in a hoop stress greater than sixty per cent of the specified minimum yield strength of the pipeline material based on its nominal wall thickness; and (ii) the block valves and check valves for the pipeline shall be so located as to prevent the escape of the corrosive or toxic gas into the atmosphere in the event of a pipeline failure; (g) the inspection of the pipeline construction materials and its appurtenances, welding, ditching, stringing and the general installation shall be in accordance with the procedure outline set out in Chapter IV of ANSI/ASME B31.8; (h) a pipeline laid- (i) in a farmland, virgin area or sparsely populated area, shall be tested with water up to a minimum pressure of 125 per cent of its designed maximum operating pressure or with air up to 110 per cent of its maximum operating pressure; (ii) in a densely populated area, shall be tested only with water up to a minimum pressure of 140 per cent of its designed maximum operating pressure,and the result of the test shall be sent to the Department; (i) a pipeline, designed to withstand twenty per cent more of the specified mini- mum yield strength, shall be tested by using pressurised air or gas between 100 psi to twenty per cent of the minimum specified yield of the material, and a pipeline designed to operate at below 100 psi shall be leak-tested at the maximum system pressure. 1 8 . Use of cast-iron material Cast-iron materials shall not be used for a gas pipeline unless- (a) specific application, supported with compelling reasons for using the cast-iron material, has been made to the Department; (b) the Department has given special approval for the material to be used; (c) the design is strictly in accordance with the specifications set out In para- graph 842 of the reference standard ANSI/ASME B31.8. 1 9. Use of plastic material (1) Thermoplastic and thermosetting plastic material of the grades specified In ASTMD 2513 and ASTMD 1217 may be used for laying service lines only. (2) The guidelines for the use of plastic materials are as follows, that is- (a) where the value of the plastic design factor is not less than 0.32 for any case, the design pressure for the plastic gas pipeline shall be in accordance with the formula given in paragraph 842.31 of ANSI/ASME B31.80; (b) the plastic materials shall be used in any service where the maximum and minimum operating temperatures are higher than IOO&deg;F or lower than minus 20 of respectively; (c) the plastic materials used shall be inhibited against the effect of ultra-violet rays which renders such materials brittle when exposed to sunlight; (d) the plastic pipes or tubing shall not be threaded at joints but shall be jointed by the solvent cement method, adhesive method, heat-fusion or by means of com- pression coupling or flanging, whichever conforms with the manufacturer's specifications; (e) extreme caution shall be taken in laying "
