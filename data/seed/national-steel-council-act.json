By virtue of this Act, there shall, on the appointed day, be vested in- (a) the Council; and ( b ) the companies referred to in paragraph ( b ) of section 2 (1) of this Act (in this Schedule referred to as \"the beneficiary companies\"),all assets, funds, resources and other movable or immovable property, which immediately before the appointed day were vested in the Nigeria Steel Development Authority (hereinafter in this Schedule referred to as the \"dissolved Authority\") and in accordance with such formula for apportionment between the bodies herein first mentioned, as the Minister may deem appropriate. 2. As from the appointed day and subject as provided in paragraph 1 above- (a) the rights, interests, obligations and liabilities of the dissolved Authority existing immediately before the appointed day under any contract or instrument, or at law or in equity shall by virtue of this Act be deemed to have been assigned to and vested in the Councilor, as the case may be, the beneficiary companies; (b) any such contract or instrument as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, shall be of the same force and effect against or in favour of the Councilor, as the case may be, of any of the beneficiary companies and shall be enforceable as fully and effectively as if instead of the dissolved Authority, the Council or the relevant beneficiary company had been named therein or had been a party thereto; and (c) the Council, or as the case may be, the relevant beneficiary company, shall be subject to all the obligations and liabilities to which the dissolved Authority was subject immediately before the appointed day and all persons shall, as from the appointed day, have the same rights, powers and remedies against the Councilor the relevant beneficiary company as they had against the dissolved Authority immediately before the appointed day. 3. Any proceeding or cause of action pending or existing immediately before the appointed day by or against the dissolved Authority in respect of any right, interest, obligation or liability of the dissolved Authority, may be continued, or as the case may require, commenced, and the determination of a court of law, tribunal or other authority or person may be enforced by or against the Council or the relevant beneficiary company (and in cases of doubt, one of such bodies or combination thereof, as the Minister may specify in any particular case), to the same extent that such cause of action or determination might have been continued or commenced or enforced by or against the dissolved Authority as if this Act had not been made. 4. Notwithstanding the dissolution of the dissolved Authority by section 9 of this Act, but subject to such directions as the Minister may give to the Council and the beneficiary companies, any person who immediately before the appointed day held office under the dissolved Authority shall, on the appointed day, be deemed to have been transferred to the Councilor the relevant beneficiary company on terms and conditions not less favourable than those obtaining immediately before the appointed day; and service under the dissolved Authority shall be deemed to be service under the Council and such relevant beneficiary companies for pensions purposes. 5. For the purposes of paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the terms and conditions comprised in any transferred appointment, shall not be construed as being less favourable merely because they are not in all respects identical or superior to the terms and conditions enjoyed by any person concerned, immediately before the appointed day, if the first-mentioned terms and conditions taken as a whole offer substantially equivalent or greater benefits. 6. Within the twelve months next after the making of this Act, the Minister, if he thinks fit, may by order published in the Federal Ga z ette make additional transitional or saving provisions, for the better carrying out of the objectives of this Schedule. In this Schedule- \"appointed day\" means the day of coming into force of this Act; \"beneficiary companies\" has the meaning assigned thereto by paragraph 1 of this Schedule and \"beneficiary company\" and \"relevant beneficiary company\" shall be construed accordingly; \"dissolved Authority\" has the meaning assigned thereto by paragraph 1 of this Schedule.
