Establishment of Disciplinary Tribunal and Investigating Panel (1) There shall be a tribunal, to be known as the Registered Engineers Disciplinary Tribunal (hereafter in this Act referred to as \"the Tribunal\"), which shall be charged with the duty of considering and determining any case referred to it by the Panel established by the following provisions of this section and any other case of which the Tribunal has cognisance under the following provisions of this Act.

(3) There shall be a body to be known as the Registered Engineers Investigating Panel (hereafter in this Act referred to as \"the Panel\"), which shall be charged with the duty of- (a) conducting a preliminary investigation into any case where it is alleged that a person fully or provisionally registered has misbehaved in his capacity as such, or should for any other reason be the subject of proceedings before the Tribunal; and (b) deciding whether the case should be referred to the Tribunal. (4) The Panel shall be appointed by the Council and shall consist of seven members of the Council. (5) The provisions of the Second Schedule to this Act shall, so far as applicable to the Tribunal and the Panel respectively, have effect with respect to those bodies. [Second Schedule.] 16. Penalties for unprofessional conduct (1) Where- (a) a person fully registered under this Act is convicted, by any court in Nigeria or elsewhere having power to award imprisonment, of an offence (whether or not an offence punishable with imprisonment) which in the opinion of the Tribunal is incompatible with the status of a registered engineer; or (b) a person provisionally registered under this Act is likewise so convicted in circumstances such that the Council is satisfied that his name ought to be removed from the register; or (c) the Tribunal is satisfied that the name of any person has been fraudulently registered; or (d) the Tribunal is satisfied that the partnership, firm or organisation has been practising as engineers or engineering consultants without the annual registration, [1992 No. 27.] the Tribunal may, if it thinks fit, give a direction reprimanding that person if fully registered or whether or not fully registered, ordering the Registrar to strike his name off the relevant part of the register. (2) The Tribunal may, if it thinks fit, defer or further defer its decision as to the giving of a direction under subsection (1) of this section until a subsequent meeting of the Tribunal; but- (a) no decision shall be deferred under this subsection for periods exceeding two years in the aggregate; and (b) no person shall be a member of the Tribunal for the purposes of reaching a decision which has been deferred or further deferred unless he was present as a member of the Tribunal when the decision was deferred. (3) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, a person shall not be treated as convicted as mentioned in paragraph (a) of that subsection unless the conviction stands at a time when no appeal or further appeal is pending or may (without extension of time) be brought in connection with the conviction. (4) When the Tribunal gives a direction under subsection (1) of this section, the Tribunal shall cause notice of the direction to be served on the person to whom it relates. (5) The person to whom such a direction relates may, at any time within 28 days from the date of service on him of the notice of the direction, appeal against the direction to the Court of Appeal, and the Tribunal may appear as respondent to the appeal and, for the purpose of enabling directions to be given as to the costs of the appeal and of proceedings before the Tribunal, shall be deemed to be a party thereto, whether or not it appears on the hearing of the appeal. (6) A direction of the Tribunal under subsection (1) of this section shall take effect- (a) where no appeal under this section is brought against the direction within the time limited for the appeal, on the expiration of that time; (b) where such an appeal is brought and is withdrawn or struck out for want of prosecution, on the withdrawal or striking out of the appeal; (c) where such an appeal is brought and is not withdrawn or struck out as aforesaid, if and when the appeal is dismissed, and shall not take effect except in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this subsection. (7) A person whose name is removed from the register in pursuance of a direction of the Tribunal under this section shall not be entitled to be registered again except in pursuance of a direction in that behalf given by the Tribunal on the application of that person; and a direction under this section for the removal of a person's name from the register may prohibit an application under this subsection by that person until the expiration of such period from the date of the direction (and where he has duly made such an application, from the date of his last application) as may be specified in the direction. Miscellaneous and general 17. Provisional registration of persons not citizens of Nigeria (1) Where a person satisfies the Council- (a) that he has been selected for employment for a specified period in a capacity in which a person fully registered as an engineer under this Act would normally be employed and that he is or intends to be in Nigeria temporarily for the purposes of serving for that period in the employment in question; (b) that he holds, or has passed examinations necessary for obtaining some qualification granted outside Nigeria, which is for the time being accepted by the Council for the purposes of this section as respects the capacity in which, if employed, he is to serve, the Council may, if it thinks fit, give a direction that he shall be temporarily registered as an engineer. (2) The temporary registration of a person shall continue only while he is in such employment as is mentioned in subsection (1) (a) of this section and shall cease- (a) on the termination of the period of employment specified to the Council under that subsection; or (b) on the termination of the said employment before the end of that period, whichever occurs first: Provided that nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Council from giving a further direction under subsection (1) of this section in respect of a specified period whose commencement coincides with the termination of another such period. (3) A person who is temporarily registered shall, in relation to his employment as mentioned in subsection (1) (a) of this section, and to things done or omitted in the course of that employment, be deemed to be fully registered, but in relation to all other matters he shall be treated as not so registered. (4) In case of doubt as to whether a person's employment has been terminated, the decision of the Council shall be conclusive for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section. (5) Nothing in this section shall have effect to exempt any person provisionally registered as an engineer pursuant to this section from payment of an annual practising fee. (6) The Registrar, as directed from time to time by the Council, shall remove from the register the name of any person ceasing to be entitled to the benefit of this section. 18. Offences (1) Any person not a registered engineer who- (a) for or in expectation of reward practises or holds himself out to practise as such; or (b) without reasonable excuse takes or uses any name, title, addition or description implying that he is authorised by law to practise as a registered engineer, shall be guilty of an offence.
