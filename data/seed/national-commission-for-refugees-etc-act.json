SCHEDULES FIRST SCHEDULE [Section 15 (a). ] Articles of Conventions applicable to recognised refugees and protected persons CHAPTER I Articles of Convention relating to the status of refugees of the 28th July, 195/ ARTICLE I Definition of the term \"refugee\" A . For the purposes of the present Convention, the term \"refugee\" shall apply to any person who- (1) Has been considered a refugee under the Arrangements of 12 May, 1926 and 30 June, 1928 or under the Conventions of 28 October, 1933 and 10 February, 1938, the Pro- tocol of 14 September, 1939 or the Constitution of the International Refugee Organisation; Decisions of non-eligibility taken by the International Refugee Organisation during the period of its activities shall not prevent the status of refugee being accorded to persons who fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 of this section. (2) As a result of events occurring before 1 January, 1951 and owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is willing to return to it. In the case of a person who has more than one nationality, the term \"the country of his nationality\" shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of his nationality if, without any valid reason based on well-founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national. B . (1) For the purposes of this Convention, the words \"events occurring before 1 January, 1951\" in Article 1, section A, shall be understood to mean either- (a) \"events occurring in Europe before 1 January, 1951\"; or (b) \"events occurring in Europe or elsewhere before I January, 1951\", and each Contracting State shall make a declaration at the time of signature, ratification or accession, specifying which of these meanings it applies for the purpose of its obligations under this Convention. (2) Any Contracting State which has adopted alternative (a) may at any time extend its obligations by adopting alternative (b) by means of notification addressed to the Secretary- General of the United Nations. C . This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if- (l) he has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his national- ity; or (2) having lost his nationality, he has voluntarily re-acquired it; or (3) he has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of the country of his new nationality; or (4) he has voluntarily re-established himself in the country which he left or outside which he remained, owing to fear of persecution; or (5) he can no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protec- tion of the country of his nationality: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (1) of this Article, who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecu- tion, for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality; (6) Being a person who has no nationality he is, because the circumstances in connec- tion with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, able to return to the country of his former habitual residence: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (1) of this Article who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecu- tion, for refusing to return to the country of his former habitual residence. D . This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations, other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu- gees, protection or assistance. When such protection or assistance has ceased for any reason, without the position of such person being definitively settled in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, these persons shall ipso facto be entitled to the benefits of this Convention. E. This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognised by the competent authori- ties of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country. F . The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that- (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; (b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge, prior to his admission to that country as a refugee; (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. ARTICLE 2 General obligations Every refugee has duties to the country in which he finds himself, which require in par- ticular that he conform to its laws and regulations, as well as to measures taken for the main- tenance of public order. ARTICLE 3 Non-discrimination The Contracting States shall apply the provisions of this Convention to refugees without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin. ARTICLE 4 Religion The Contracting State shall accord to refugees within their territories treatment at least as favourable as that accorded to their nationals with respect to freedom to practise their religion and freedom, as regards the religious education of their children. ARTICLES Rights granted apart from this Convention Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to impair any rights and benefits granted by a Contracting State to refugees apart from this Convention. ARTICLE 6 The term \"in the same circumstances\" For the purpose of this Convention, the term \"in the same circumstances\" implies that any requirements (including requirements as to length and conditions of sojourn or residence), which the particular individual would have to fulfil for the enjoyment of the right in question, if he were not a refugee, must be fulfilled by him, with the exception of requirements which, by their nature, a refugee is incapable of fulfilling. ARTICLE 7 Exemption from reciprocity 1. Except where this Convention contains more favourable provisions, a Contracting State shall accord to refugees the same treatment as is accorded to aliens generally. 2. After a period of three years' residence, all refugees shall enjoy exemption from legisla- tive reciprocity in the territory of the Contracting States. 3 . Each Contracting State shall continue to accord to refugees the rights and benefits to which they were already entitled, in the absence of reciprocity, at the date of entry into force of this Convention for that State. 4. The Contracting States shall consider favourably the possibility of according to refugees, in the absence of reciprocity, rights and benefits beyond those to which they are entitled, ac- cording to paragraphs 2 and 3, to extending exemption from reciprocity to refugees who do not fulfil the conditions provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3. 5 . The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 apply both to the rights and benefits referred to in Articles 13, 18, 19, 21 and 22 of this Convention and to rights and benefits for which this Convention does not provide.
