Provisions where pioneer certificate operates retrospectively Subject to the provisions of section 6 of this Act, where a pioneer certificate is to be operative from a retrospective date, then any act or thing which has been done or which has happened for the purposes of the principal Act since that date, but which would not have been done or happened if the pioneer certificate had been in force at that date, shall, whenever necessary for the purposes of this Act and the principal Act, be treated as not having been done or not having happened, and if the act consists of the payment of any tax by a company certified to be a pioneer company, that tax shall, as soon as may be after the expiration of three months from the production day of that company, be repaid to the company by the Board. 6 .

(3) In determining the amount of qualifying capital expenditure incurred by a pioneer company prior to its production day, any sum derived directly or indirectly by that com- pany from any disposal (made before that day) of any asset on which qualifying capital expenditure has been incurred shall be taken into account for the purpose of reducing the amount of the qualifying capital expenditure; but where the disposal of such asset is by way of bargain not made at arm's length or is to any person who is controlled by the pion- eer company or who has control over the pioneer company, the asset shall be deemed to have been disposed of for an amount, which in the opinion of the Board, the asset would have fetched if sold in the open market at the date of the disposal, less the amount of any expenses which the company might reasonably be expected to incur if the asset were so sold. (4) After considering any application made under subsection (1) of this section, to- gether with such further information as he may call for, the Director shall issue a certifi- cate to the pioneer company certifying the date of its production day.

(8) When the amount of the qualifying capital expenditure incurred by the pioneer company prior to production day has been finally determined and certified by the Board, the Board shall notify the Minister of that amount.

(10) Where a certificate issued by the Director under subsection (4) of this section certifies that the date of the production day of a pioneer company is more than one year later than the estimate thereof given in the company's application for a pioneer certifi- cate, the Minister shall report that fact to the President and the President shall cancel the pioneer certificate of that company unless he is satisfied that the delay is due to causes outside the control of the company or to other good and sufficient causes. (11) Where a certificate issued by the Board under subsection (5) of this section certi- fies that the pioneer company has on or before production day incurred qualifying capital expenditure of an amount which- (a) in the case of an indigenous-controlled company, is less than N 50,000; or (b) in the case of any other company, is less than N 150,000, the Commissioner shall report that fact to the President and the President shall cancel the pioneer certificate of the company.

(2) The Board may, in relation to any statement issued under section 14 (4) of this Act, declare that the whole or a specified part of the profits is not in dispute, and any such undisputed profits shall be exempt from tax under the principal Act pending the statement becoming final and conclusive. 17 . Exemption o f certain dividends from income tax (1) Wherever any amount of profits of a pioneer company is exempt from tax under section 16 of this Act, that amount shall immediately be credited by the pioneer company to an account to be kept by it for the purposes of this section. (2) Where at the date of payment of any dividends by the pioneer company the said account is in credit, the dividends, or so much of the dividends where (after the end of its tax relief period) the amount thereof exceeds such credit, as equal the amount of such credit, shall be debited to the account. (3) So much of the amount of any dividends so debited to the account as are received by a shareholder in the pioneer company shall, if the Board is satisfied with the entries in the account, be exempt from tax in the hands of that shareholder and shall for the pur- poses of the principal Act and the Personal Income Tax Act, be deemed to be paid out of profits on which tax is not paid or payable. [Cap. P8.] (4) Any dividends so debited to the account shall be treated as having been distrib- uted to the shareholders or any particular class of shareholders of the pioneer company, in the same proportions as those shareholders were entitled to payment of the dividends giving rise to the debit. (5) Whenever called upon so to do by notice in writing sent by the Board to the reg- istered office of a pioneer company, the company shall, until such time as the Board is satisfied that there is no further need for maintaining the account, deliver to the Board a copy of the account made up to a date specified by the Board in the notice. (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16 of this Act and of this section, where it appears to the relevant tax authority that any amount of exempted profits of a pioneer company, or any dividend exempted in the hands of a shareholder, ought not to have been exempted by reason of- (a) a direction under section 13 of this Act having been made with respect to a pioneer company, after any profit of that company has been exempted under the provisions of section 16 of this Act; or (b) the cancellation of a pioneer certificate, the relevant tax authority may at any time within six years of the direction or cancellation make such additional assessment upon the pioneer company or shareholder as may appear to the relevant tax authority necessary in order to counteract any benefit obtained from the amount which ought not to have been exempted. (7) For the purposes of subsection (6) of this section, \" r e l evant tax authority\" has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Personal Income Tax Act, and in relation to any additional assessment to be made on a company under the said subsection (6), it means the Board.
