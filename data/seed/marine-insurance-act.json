Rules for construction of policy [Section 25.] 1. Where the subject matter is insured \"lost or not lost\", and the loss has occurred before the contract is concluded, the risk attaches, unless at such time the assured was aware of the loss, and the insurer was not. 2. Where the subject matter is insured \"from\" a particular place, the risk does not attach until the ship starts on the voyage insured. 3. (a) Where a ship is insured \"at and from\" a particular place, and she is at that place in good safety when the contract is concluded the risk attaches immediately. If she be not there when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as she arrives there in good safety. ( b) If she be not at that place when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as she arrives there in good safety, and, unless the policy otherwise provides, it is immaterial that she is covered by another policy for a specified time after arrival. (c ) Where chartered freight is insured \"at and from\" a particular place, and the ship is at that place in good safety when the contract is concluded the risk attaches immediately. If she be not there when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as she arrives there in good safety. (d ) Where freight, other than chartered freight, is payable without special conditions and is insured \"at and from\" a particular place, the risk attaches pro rata as the goods or merchan- dise are shipped; provided that if there be cargo in readiness which belongs to the shipowner, or which some other person has contracted with him to ship, the risk attaches as soon as the ship is ready to receive such cargo. 4. Where goods or other movables are insured \"from the loading thereof', the risk does not attach until such goods or movables are actually on board, and the insurer is not liable for them while in transit from the shore to ship. 5. Where the risk on goods or other movables continues until they are \"safety landed\", they shall be landed in the customary manner and within a reasonable time after arrival at the port of discharge, and if they ar"
